# Concept : Function that RETURNS a LIST
# Until now, you returned numbers/strings.
# Today: return a list.

# Example idea (not code):

# Input list → [5, 12, 7, 20]

# Output list → [12, 20] (numbers > 10)


# Task: 1

# Write a function that:
# Takes a list of numbers
# Returns a new list of only EVEN numbers
