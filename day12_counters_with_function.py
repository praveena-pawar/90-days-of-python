# We will practice:

# Functions + Loops + Conditions (deeper)

# Returning multiple values

# Using index while looping

# String + List logic together



#  Task : 1

# Given a list of numbers, write a function that:
# Counts how many are positive
# Counts how many are negativ
# Counts how many are zero
# Return all three values.
