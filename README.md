# 90 Days of Python – Logic & DSA Journey

This repository documents my 90-day journey of mastering Python with a strong focus on logic building, problem solving, and interview preparation.

The goal is not just to learn syntax, but to develop a structured problem-solving mindset used in real technical interviews.



##  What This Repository Contains

Daily Python practice focused on:

- Conditional logic & loops
- Functions and clean code structure
- Lists and dictionary problem patterns
- String logic and pattern recognition
- Array traversal and tracking techniques
- Adjacent comparison and streak problems
- Sliding window foundations
- Hash map patterns
- Core DSA problem-solving strategies

Each file represents a day of focused practice and progression.
